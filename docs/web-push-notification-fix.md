# Web Push Notification Fix

## Issue
Users were not receiving notifications when the browser/PWA was closed because:

1. **No Server-Side Trigger**: The `/api/queue-monitor` endpoint existed but was never called
2. **Only In-App Notifications**: The system only sent notifications via Service Worker when the app was open
3. **Missing Background Process**: No mechanism to send web push notifications when users are offline

## Root Cause
The notification system had two separate components that weren't connected:
- **Frontend Service Worker**: Shows notifications when app is open
- **Backend Web Push API**: Can send notifications when app is closed, but was never triggered

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Queue Operations
Updated `/pages/api/computer-queue/index.js` to automatically trigger web push notifications when:
- A user joins the queue
- A user leaves the queue (admin removal)
- Queue positions change due to someone leaving
- Admin reorders the queue

### 2. Direct Web Push Integration
Instead of making HTTP requests to the queue-monitor API, the queue operations now:
- Directly access push subscriptions from Supabase
- Send web push notifications using the `web-push` library
- Update user position tracking in the `user_queue_positions` table

### 3. Notification Types
The system now sends different notifications based on the action:
- **üéÆ Joined Queue**: When user joins
- **üëã Left Queue**: When admin removes user
- **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Queue Position Update**: When position improves
- **üéâ Your Turn!**: When user reaches position #1

## Technical Implementation

### Functions Added
- `triggerWebPushNotifications()`: Main function to send web push notifications
- Enhanced queue operations to call this function after database changes

### Database Operations
- Updates `user_queue_positions` table to track position changes
- Fetches active push subscriptions from `push_subscriptions` table
- Maintains position tracking for accurate notifications

### Notification Flow
1. User performs queue action (join/leave/reorder)
2. Database is updated
3. Affected users are identified
4. Push subscriptions are fetched
5. Web push notifications are sent in background
6. Users receive notifications even with closed browser

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps
1. User subscribes to web push notifications
2. User joins queue
3. Close browser/PWA completely
4. Admin removes someone ahead of user (to trigger position change)
5. User should receive notification even with closed app

### Verification Points
- Check browser console for notification logs
- Verify Supabase tables are updated correctly
- Test on different browsers and mobile devices
- Confirm notifications work in airplane mode (when reopened)

## Browser Support
- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support  
- Safari (iOS): Limited (requires add to home screen)
- Mobile browsers: Works when added as PWA

## Environment Variables Required
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapid_public_key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_vapid_private_key
VAPID_EMAIL=mailto:your_email@domain.com
```

## Database Tables Used
- `push_subscriptions`: Stores user web push subscription endpoints
- `user_queue_positions`: Tracks current user positions for change detection
- `computer_queue`: Main queue table

## Files Modified
- `/pages/api/computer-queue/index.js`: Added web push notification triggers
- Service Worker and web push utilities remain unchanged (already working)

## Future Improvements
- Add rate limiting to prevent notification spam
- Implement notification preferences (user can choose notification types)
- Add retry mechanism for failed push notifications
- Consider implementing batch notifications for multiple position changes
